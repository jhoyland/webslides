# webslides
A framework for create powerpoint / beamer style slide shows as websides

Abstract: The objective of this project is to create powerpointesque slide shows using HTML. Slides will be created using a simple XML format which will then be transformed into HTML pages. Pages will be layed out using a CSS structure file which encodes common slide layouts. A further simple CSS will provide user-modifyable aesthetic styling. A set of Javascript functions using Mootools framework will then provide animation, slide transitions and image manipulation. MathJax will provide mathematical formula display.
The intended workflow is that an instructor can write a slide outline in a plain text editor with LaTeX style formulas. This can then be directly transformed into webpages with a common look and feel for hosting on any platform.
Ultimately a PHP script could serve the slides transforming on the fly.

TASKS:
1/ Basic slide layouts (Started)
2/ MathJax testing
3/ Image scaling (Javascript)
4/ Create XSLT for HTML creation
5/ Create simple markup conversion
6/ Navigation buttons
7/ Slide transitions
8/ Animation
